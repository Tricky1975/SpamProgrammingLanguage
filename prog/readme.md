# Prog

I am always willing to add your sample programs to this directory.
I am very sure you will be able to create true pieces of art here.

Simply throw me a pull request with your code.
If you created a program which will calculate all prime numbers between 0 and 100, and your name is SillyProgrammer, you can just name your file
~~~prime_numbers_by_SillyProgrammer.spam~~~

A few rules:
- Please tell me in the description of your pull request what effect the program is supposed to do.
- I will check your code in my current version of Spam to see if that effect is really reached.
- I don't mind you using the jump-instruction feature to link to your own site, however unlike real spam, I will check if that site is LEGAL and SAFE!
- I'll consider all sources written in spam posted in this directory as zLIB licensed, although the license notice should not be in the source file as that would spook up the effect this language was supposed to create. :P
- No "stealing". Don't claim code as yours when it isn't. 
- If the original coder allows you to, you can post it even if it isn't yours as long as the coder is properly credited and the coder accepts zLIB as the license for his/her code.
- Failure to comply in these rules will very likely lead to code being removed/rejected. Repeated offenses can lead to a ban from this repository (and maybe even ALL my repositories).

I may sound strict, but that is because I have to sound like that (and I hate that).
